            Hello. I am Nyi Nyein Aung but you can also Call me Leo. I am 18
            years and am currently a 3rd-year university student studying IT at
            Payap International College. I have always enjoyed learning
            Javascript and making random games in my Computer Science class back
            in high school. Then a year after I joined the university, I started
            learning web development.
          </p>

          <p>
              I enjoy playing games during my free time and I also love
            problem-solving. I usually would self-study frontend after I get
            home from university in the evening and play games with my friends
            at night. I am also very interested in technology in general and try
            my best to keep up with the updates. I really enjoy web development
            and I hope to improve my skills as I go on my learning journey.
